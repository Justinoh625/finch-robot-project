# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

## Timeline/Checklist

### Planning & Research
- Choose your challenge: dance, drawing, or maze navigation
- Explore the Finch API documentation
- Review sample programs from BirdBrain Technologies
- Create a project plan with pseudocode/flow charts/
- Clone and set up GitHub repository for your project

### Development
- Write initial code implementation
- Test basic functionality with the Finch robot
- Debug and refine your approach
- Document your progress and challenges

### Implementation & Testing
- Complete core functionality implementation
- Conduct thorough testing with the robot
- Optimize code for readability and efficiency
- Start preparing documentation

### Finalization
- Finalize code and ensure complete functionality
- Complete README documentation
- Prepare for demonstration
- Submit final project to GitHub

### Deployment
- Demonstrate your project

## Required Components

### Technical Requirements
Your program must include at least 5 of these Java/OOP concepts:
- Inheritance/Subclasses
- Method overloading or overriding
- Arrays or ArrayLists
- Loops (for, while, etc.)
- Conditional statements
- Exception handling
- File I/O for configuration or logging
- Constants and static methods
- User input processing

### Documentation Requirements
- Well-commented code with appropriate Javadoc
- GitHub repository with organized file structure
- README.md file including:
  * Project description and objectives
  * Description of design choices
  * Challenges faced and solutions
  * Future enhancements
  * Video or images of your robot in action (embedded or linked)

## Challenge-Specific Guidelines

### Dance Challenge
Create a choreographed dance routine for your Finch that synchronizes:
- Movement patterns (forward/backward, turns)
- LED light displays (beak and tail)
- Sound patterns using the buzzer
- Consider using arrays to store sequences of movements/lights/sounds

### Drawing Challenge
Program your Finch to create an artistic drawing:
- Design an algorithm to create a recognizable pattern or image
- Use precise motor control for clean lines
- Consider incorporating sensor data to affect the drawing
- Create a system to track position on the drawing surface

### Maze Navigation Challenge
Program your Finch to navigate through a maze:
- Use distance sensors to detect walls
- Implement an algorithm for maze solving (wall following, etc.)
- Consider storing and analyzing the path taken
- Add visual/audio feedback during navigation
- Optional: Allow for maze "learning" and optimization on repeated runs

## Resources
- Finch API Documentation (provided in class)
- [BirdBrain Technologies Learning Resources](https://learn.birdbraintechnologies.com/finch/java/program/)
- [Java API Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/index.html)

## Extension Opportunities
If you complete your chosen challenge early, consider:
- Adding sensor-responsive behaviors to your program
- Creating a user interface to control robot parameters (JFrame, Swing, JavaFX)
- Implementing multiple modes of operation
- Adding an obstacle detection and avoidance system

Description of design choices: during this project we opted for it to play a tune and dance. we did this by making a method with two 1d arrays where we were able to go through each index and play the certain note and certain pause requied for the tune to sound right. We made the robot dance and flash lights by making a formloop that would repeat flashing lights and and a spining motion. 
Challenges during this project: challenges we experienced while making this project was getting the music method to work effectivley. We first took this challege on by making a sequence of notes that were able to be played. However this did not make the code look pleasant. In order to sovle this issue we made 2 1d arrays in order to compact the info that is being played. and we then made the method go through each index and play them.
Future enhancements: future enchancements that we would like to make is where the bot plays a multitide of songs instead of a singular one. We would have liked to add more instruemnts the robot is able to play as well. An example where these enhancements would be beneficial would be in kanyes all of the lgihts where he uses an abundance of different instruments.
